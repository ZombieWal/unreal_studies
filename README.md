This is a repository for my Unreal Engine Studies.


There are two projects here; one of them is Marble Run; on a link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rv18eXxWj_DU0IRip9Cxa_JxbGe0Z909/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rv18eXxWj_DU0IRip9Cxa_JxbGe0Z909/view?usp=sharing) the gameplay video can be found.


The second one is a small prototype of a 3D platformer; here is a small gameplay gif:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lTt6J-2XSjGJznx-aS-h-WEGDM-3jBmt/view?usp=sharing I hope I will have time to finish it one day.
