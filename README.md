This is a repository for my Unreal Engine Studies.


There are two projects here; one of them is Marble Run; on a link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rv18eXxWj_DU0IRip9Cxa_JxbGe0Z909/view?usp=sharing the gameplay video can be found.


The second one is a small prototype on 3D platformer; hope I will have time to finish it one day.
